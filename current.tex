\end{Exercise}

\begin{Exercise}[difficulty=2]
Calculate voltage drop on a busbar with rectangular cross-section (1cm by 5cm) made of copper ($57\cdot10^{6}$ S/m. Length of a busbar is 10 meters, and total current if 1000 A.
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Exercise}[difficulty=2]
Find the resistance of wooden pipe filled with water. Assume that conductivity of the water is 1 S/mm, and 0.01 S/m for wood. The pipe is 10 meters long, external radius is 50cm, wall is 5cm thin.
